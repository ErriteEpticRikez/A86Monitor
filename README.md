# A86Monitor
A lightweight ping and website monitoring system that runs on ARM and x86.

Currently, this repository contains the code for V2.0 that rewrites the program in Rust and adds the ability for HTTP
monitoring

## History about A86Monitor
A86 Monitor was created by Michael Riley during his time at Greatnews.life / Ideas in Motion Media as an application
that would monitor the internal network for failover events to the offices secondary connection since EdgeOS did not
have support for notifications of when failovers occurred. 


## Setup
At this time the Configurator is being rewritten in Rust. This section will be updated once the configurator is starting to
be built.
